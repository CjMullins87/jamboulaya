+ Prep work
	>> Coin the sauage
	>> NOTE cutting them on a bias will give you more
	surface area for browning, so I'd recommend doing so
	>> Dice the onion, celery, red bell pepper
	>> Dice the garlic, set it aside on its own
	>> LEAVE THE SKIN ON THE CHICKEN THIGHS, pat em dry
	>> Set up the desired amount of water based on the package instructions
	>> Get a large enough dutch oven onto the stove
	>> Dice the green onion
	>> Set oven to 350F
+ Brown the sausage in the dutch oven, you won't need extra fat
	>> If you do need extra fat, I'd recommend bacon fat
+ Remove the sausage before it burns, set aside
+ Add in the onion, celery, bell pepper mixture
	>> Recommend adding a pinch of salt here to help the veggies
	soften sooner and release their water
+ Cook over medium heat until translucent/tender
	>> Add any extra fat if necessary to keep things going without
	sticking to the bottom
+ NOW you can add in the garlic, stirring until garlic is cooked but not burnt
+ Deglaze the pan by adding in your water, gently scraping the bottom to release the fond
+ Add in the seasoning packet from the box with the rice, raise the temp to medium high
+ Add in your browned sausage with any accumulated fat and stir
+ Stir on heat until a gentle simmer
+ Add in your raw chicken thighs
+ Move to oven to cook for probably 30-50 minutes
	>> Looking to get to a point where (a) the rice has absorbed all
	or most of the gravy, and (b) the chicken thighs are fully cooked
	>> The chicken thighs will have rendered all their fat + collagen
	into the gravy, so you're essentially making a chicken stock and
	cooking it into the rice at the same time
+ Remove from oven once done, set aside
	>> The pot is full of food so it won't get cold for a long time
	>> You can leave the pot open if you'd like to let steam out
+ Remove chicken thighs and set aside, let rest for 10-15 minutes
+ Debone chicken thighs
	>> Peel off the skin
	>> After a 40 minute wet cook, the thighs should fall apart
	and be easy to pull into shards by hand
+ Add thigh meat into the pot, fold it in
+ Add green onions into the pot, fold it in
+ Serve
